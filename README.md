# nextspa
React-Router SPA combined with Next.js experiment.

Inspired by this article:
https://colinhacks.com/essays/building-a-spa-with-nextjs

This project seeks to find a good way to take advantage of both traditional React SPAs with React Router and most of the powerful features of Next.js at the same time, in the same site. We'll see if this means completely replacing the Next.js router and what, if any, the best strategy would be.

It just seems like these two great design patterns and site-building strategies should be able to live togetether in harmony in the same site.
